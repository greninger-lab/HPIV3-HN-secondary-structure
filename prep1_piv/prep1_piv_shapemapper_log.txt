| Quality control checks:
| 
| (See README.md for explanation)
| 
| Read depth check:
| 73.0% (1255/1720) nucleotides meet the minimum read depth of 5000
| FAIL: Read depths are too low for accurate reactivity profile creation.
|       The modified sample is particulary low.
|       Check alignment stats to see the amount of target sequence present
|       in each sample. Better target enrichment or recovery and/or
|       additional sequencing could help solve this problem.
| 
| Mutation rate check:
| 66.6% (836/1255) nucleotides have positive mutation rates
| above background
| High background check:
| 0.1% (1/1255) nucleotides have high background
| mutation rates.
| PASS: Not too many nucleotides with high background mutation rates.
| 
| Number highly reactive check:
| 0.6% (8/1255) nucleotides show high apparent reactivity.
| FAIL
|       Possible causes:
|        - DNA contamination
|        - poor mixing of chemical reagents and RNA and/or poor
|          reagent diffusion (if modifying in cells), resulting
|          in low modification rates
|        - expired reagents, resulting in low modification rates
|        - poor reverse transcription conditions, resulting in
|          low adduct read-through
|        - extremely highly structured RNA

WARNING: This RNA has a possible poor quality reactivity profile: hpiv3_amplicon_from_s29
See quality control checks above for details.
WARNING: no random primer length was specified, but at least one RNA is longer than a typical directed-primer amplicon. If analyzing a randomly primed experiment that was not subjected to a Nextera prep, use the --random-primer-len option to exclude mutations within primer binding regions.
